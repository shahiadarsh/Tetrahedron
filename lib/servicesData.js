          question: "How much space is typically needed for a Mini Dojo?",
          answer: "It varies greatly depending on the skill being taught. It could range from a small tabletop setup to a corner of a room (e.g., 5-10 square meters), significantly less than a full Dojo.",

        {
          question: "Can Mini Dojos incorporate digital elements?",

It's a fundamental component of quality management systems, particularly mandated by standards like IATF 16949 for the automotive industry, but essential across manufacturing sectors.\n\nThe primary goal of MSA is to ensure that the data collected for process control, capability analysis, and product acceptance is reliable and trustworthy. By quantifying measurement uncertainty, MSA helps distinguish between actual process variation and variation introduced by the measurement system (gauges, operators, methods, environment). This allows for accurate assessment of process performance and informed decision-making.", // Combined and rephrased from "About Measurement System Analysis (MSA)" section
